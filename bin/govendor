# To add or update a Go package, add it to `go.mod`, then vendor it.
# This tool `govendor` performs these steps together.
#
# For example, to add the latest version of a new dependency:
#
#   govendor github.com/kr/pretty
#
# Or, to update an existing dependency:
#
#   govendor github.com/kr/pretty@v0.1.0
#
# See `go help module-get` for details on the meaning of
# these command line arguments.
